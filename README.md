# Bike Sharing Demand Analysis with Tableau

## Overview

This project analyzes bike-sharing systems using a dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to understand the factors influencing bike rental demand and to visualize these insights using Tableau. By exploring patterns in bike usage, we aim to provide actionable insights that can benefit traffic management, environmental planning, and public health initiatives.

## Tableau Dashboard Illustration

An interactive Tableau dashboard has been created to visualize the findings:

You can explore the full dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/bikesharing_17311062366660/BikeSharing).

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical data on bike rentals, including:

- **Temporal Information**: Dates and times of bike rentals.
- **Rental Counts**: Number of bikes rented, including distinctions between casual and registered users.
- **Weather Conditions**: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather situation.

Bike-sharing systems act as virtual sensors in the city, capturing mobility patterns that can help detect important urban events and trends.

## Project Objective

- **Analyze Factors Affecting Bike Demand**: Investigate how weather, time, and user type influence bike rentals.
- **Visualize Data with Tableau**: Create an interactive dashboard to present findings in an accessible format.
- **Provide Insights for Stakeholders**: Offer data-driven recommendations for city planners and bike-sharing companies.

## Methodology

The project involves:

1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and organizing the dataset for analysis in Tableau.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends and correlations in the data.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Developing interactive visualizations to showcase key insights.

## Tableau Dashboard

The Tableau dashboard includes:

- **Total Bike Rentals**: Visualization of total bike rentals over time.
- **Weather Impact**: Relationship between weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed) and bike rentals.
- **Hourly Usage Patterns**: Peak hours for bike rentals on weekdays and weekends.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Bike rental patterns across different seasons.

## Findings

- **Peak Usage Times**:
  - **Weekdays**: Highest demand during morning (7 AM - 9 AM) and evening (4 PM - 7 PM) commuting hours.
  - **Weekends**: Increased usage during midday hours (10 AM - 4 PM).

- **Weather Influence**:
  - **Temperature**: Optimal bike rentals occur at moderate temperatures (20°C - 30°C).
  - **Humidity**: Extremely high or low humidity levels can decrease bike rentals.
  - **Wind Speed**: Generally minimal impact unless wind conditions are extreme.

- **Seasonal Trends**:
  - Higher bike rentals during spring and summer months.
  - Decreased rentals in winter due to colder weather and shorter daylight hours.

## Dataset Illustration

The analysis was conducted using the [Bike Sharing Demand Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand) from Kaggle, which provides detailed information on bike rentals and associated factors.

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that bike-sharing demand is influenced by time of day, weather conditions, user type, and seasonality. Understanding these factors can help optimize bike availability, improve service for users, and assist in urban planning to promote sustainable transportation.
